## 1.2.0 (Unreleased)

NEW FEATURES:

* `precondition` and `postcondition` check blocks for resources, data sources, and module output values: module authors can now document assumptions and assertions about configuration and state values. If these conditions are not met, Terraform will report a custom error message to the user and halt further evaluation.
* Terraform now supports [run tasks](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks), a Terraform Cloud integration for executing remote operations, for the post plan stage of a run.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* The "Invalid for_each argument" error message for unknown maps/sets now includes an additional paragraph to try to help the user notice they can move apply-time values into the map _values_ instead of the map _keys_, and thus avoid the problem without resorting to `-target`. [GH-30327]
* When showing the progress of a remote operation running in Terraform Cloud, Terraform CLI will include information about post-plan [run tasks](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks). [GH-30141]

BUG FIXES:

* Terraform now handles type constraints, nullability, and custom variable validation properly for root module variables. Previously there was an order of operations problem where the nullability and custom variable validation were checked too early, prior to dealing with the type constraints, and thus that logic could potentially "see" an incorrectly-typed value in spite of the type constraint, leading to incorrect errors. [GH-29959]
* `terraform show -json`: JSON plan output now correctly maps aliased providers to their configurations, and includes the full provider source address alongside the short provider name. [GH-30138]
* Terraform now prints a warning when adding an attribute to `ignore_changes` that is managed only by the provider (non-optional computed attribute). [GH-30517]
