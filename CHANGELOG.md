## 1.2.0 (Unreleased)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* The "Invalid for_each argument" error message for unknown maps/sets now includes an additional paragraph to try to help the user notice they can move apply-time values into the map _values_ instead of the map _keys_, and thus avoid the problem without resorting to `-target`. [GH-30327]

BUG FIXES:

* Terraform now handles type constraints, nullability, and custom variable validation properly for root module variables. Previously there was an order of operations problem where the nullability and custom variable validation were checked too early, prior to dealing with the type constraints, and thus that logic could potentially "see" an incorrectly-typed value in spite of the type constraint, leading to incorrect errors. [GH-29959]
